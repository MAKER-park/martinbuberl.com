Hi, I'm Martin.

Living in charming Copenhagen, I bring the New York hustle to Scandinavia.

As <a target="_blank" href="https://stackoverflow.com/story/martinbuberl">VP of Engineering</a> at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/trustpilot">Trustpilot</a> I'm <span class="highlight">dedicated to building the best engineering team</span> in the Nordics. My focus is on high leverage activities to produce maximum impact, product value and iteration speed - but I always put humans first. I'm an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.meetup.com/Copenhagen-AWS-User-Group/">AWS User Group Leader</a> and a mentor for early-stage Startups at <a target="_blank" href="http://venturecup.dk/">Venture Cup</a>.

In the analog world I enjoy running and cooking for friends. When I want to get away from it all I love to globe trot, especially when snorkeling or outdoor adventure is involved.
