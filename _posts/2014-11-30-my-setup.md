I'm typing this on a 13-inch <a target="_blank" href="http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/">Macbook Pro</a> with Retina display - even though I'm a PC guy from way back. It's a great machine and I usually carry it around with me wherever I go in a blue <a target="_blank" href="http://shop.herschelsupply.com/collections/messenger-bags/products/columbia-messenger-navy">Herschel Columbia</a> messenger bag together with a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/8883701038/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=8883701038&linkCode=as2&tag=martinbuberl-20&linkId=D3VWLWQSOGFKSPRT">Moleskine</a>.

These days I prefer mobility over a desktop with multiple screens and enjoy the freedom to work wherever I want. Tiny New Yorker apartments might have had something to do with that transition - but I actually do embrace it.

I run Bootcamp with both, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X_Yosemite">OS X Yosemite</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_8.1">Windows 8.1</a> on it. In general, I prefer my environments to be as browser-centric and OS-agnostic as possible.

That said, almost all apps and services I use run in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/chrome/">Chrome</a> (to be exact <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/canary.html">Chrome Canary</a>) - either as an <a target="_blank" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions">extension</a> or <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service">SaaS</a>. Exceptions are <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio</a> as well as a few other developer tools that need to be installed. Which OS I boot depends only on the stack of the software project I'm working on. Usually that means if a project requires Visual Studio, I boot Windows and for everything else I boot OS X.

For email, productivity and communication I use <a target="_blank" href="http://goo.gl/xfPFhk">G Suite</a>. Needless to say that all my files are stored in the cloud either on <a target="_blank" href="http://goo.gl/xfPFhk">Google Drive</a> or - if source code - on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> and sync seamlessly between all systems.

Another essential app for me is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.skype.com/">Skype</a>, because that's how I stay in touch with family and friends overseas.

You can find a complete list of tools and services I use [over here]({{ site.url }}/resources/). That page actually represents all of my bookmarks. The only bookmarks I keep in my browser are sites I use all the time as a <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/martinbuberl/status/539582495545909250">"Favicon Only" bookmark bar</a>.

Interesting sidenote: I don't have a single game installed on any device and won't do so in the future. Finding myself working often remotely, I've made a point of physically separating work and play using my <a target="_blank" href="http://www.playstation.com/">PlayStation</a> exclusively for video games. It works surprisingly well for me.

When I'm on the go I defer to my <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/nexus/5/">Nexus 5</a>, which has been a great device. It syncs flawlessly with my Google account, and I couldn't be happier with it.

Whenever I'm working on a desktop and I can choose, I prefer to type on a [mechanical keyboard]({{ site.url }}/blog/get-a-great-keyboard/) while sitting on a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002K11BK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0002K11BK&linkCode=as2&tag=martinbuberl-20&linkId=FYRT3ZUQ7X2M5HXA">Herman Miller Mirra</a> chair. I've tried standing desks, but found myself not really using them.

I'm not too big on gadgets, but two are worth mentioning. I find <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DR0PDNE/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00DR0PDNE&linkCode=as2&tag=martinbuberl-20&linkId=VSUFVRR5I5UFZ2H2">Chromecast</a> to be a fine extension to my overall setup and love to project and present wirelessly. Another gadget I use almost daily is my <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F51C6S8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00F51C6S8&linkCode=as2&tag=martinbuberl-20&linkId=7XBLVUG2EE5FHZXT">Boom Swimmer</a> bluetooth speaker. In the backyard, kitchen or in the shower this waterproof speaker follows me wherever I hang at home and listen to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.spotify.com/">Spotify</a> or <a target="_blank" href="http://serialpodcast.org/">podcasts</a>.
