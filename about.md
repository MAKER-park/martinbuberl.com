Hi, I'm Martin Buberl and this is my little corner of the Internet. Living and working in lovely Copenhagen, I bring the New York hustle to Scandinavia. As a <a target="_blank" href="https://stackoverflow.com/story/martinbuberl">Director of Engineering at Trustpilot</a> I'm doing whatever I can to make it even more awesome.

For over a decade I've been passionate about elegant code and how to make the web a better place by using the [best tools for the job](/resources/). [I love moving fast](/blog/move-fast-and-break-things-but-know-when-its-broken/) and being agile - the status quo bores me.

In the analog world I unwind with cooking and exploration of the world's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1m7aKRR3_tNcR6r6iZYpNhjIhVkE">most livable city</a>. When I want to get away from it all I love to globe trot, especially when snorkeling or outdoor adventure is involved.
