Have a “<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_No_Asshole_Rule">no jerks!</a>“ policy in place and enforce it. Always be intolerant of intolerance. This can be particularly important with external people your team has to work with like clients, vendors and partners. Don’t allow bullying behavior in your workplace. It worsens morale and productivity.


- teams that build high quality software can't have jerks on them
- jerks lower software quality because they hurt collaboration and collaboration is key for high quality software
- ‎there's no trade off - jerks always hurt
- ‎brilliant ideas aren't worth anything if they can't be vetted by rest of team (jerks rarely collaborate and rarely search for feedback)
- ‎jerks go rouge building "brilliant" things alone and have disproportional impact with lower quality code

""
- ‎how to rehab brilliant jerks
- ‎tell them: do you consider all the data? (emotional data, EQ)

- Technicall Strong Assholes (TSA)
  - 1.5x faster than other, maybe leading an important initiative
    - ... but make life hell for everbody else (1x -> .8x)

1 tsa x 1.5 strength + 9 engineers x .8 strength = 8.7 effort
0 tsa x 1.5 strength + 9 engineers x 1 strength = 9 effort
