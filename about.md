Hi, I'm Martin Buberl and this is my little corner of the internet. I'm a happy-go-lucky guy from Europe, developer of all things web and wannabe entrepreneur living in New York City.

For over a decade I've been passionate about elegant code and how to make the web a better place by using the [best tools for the job](/resources/). [I love moving fast](/blog/move-fast-and-break-things-but-know-when-its-broken/) and being agile - the status quo bores me.

In the analog world I lace my soccer cleats at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.brooklynbridgepark.org/activities/soccer">world's most stunning amateur pitch</a>, and to unwind I dabble in cooking or exploration of the endless <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=z0LjC9OnxbQk.k1owu1D1B2zg">eateries and watering holes</a> around the city. When I want to get away from it all I love to globe trot with my <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/jmcallahan">wonderful wife</a>, especially when snorkeling or outdoor adventure is involved.
