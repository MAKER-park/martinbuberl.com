# How to achieve an (almost) empty inbox and keep it that way

Most of us spend far too much time in our email inboxes and many of us are struggling to keep up with the constant inflow of new messages. To help you become more productive and responsive, I want to share a few simple techniques that help me to keep my inbox empty — or almost empty — at all times.

## Almost empty is good enough

My inbox usually has a few emails in it, and that’s totally okay. There’s no need to obsess over getting that inbox completely empty. The problem with emails is that they keep coming and therefore an empty inbox won’t stay empty for very long. What matters is that you keep it to a manageable size — for me that’s about five emails. The goal is to minimize the time spent in your inbox, and not to spin your wheels.

## Check your inbox periodically

Don’t leave your email client (or browser tab) open all day and resist the urge to check it constantly. If those naggy notifications give you [fear of missing out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out), disable them. Go ahead and disable them right now — I’ll wait here. Now, that you’re not getting triggered anymore for every single email you receive, check your inbox periodically throughout the day. Depending on your personal inflow volume that could be 3 times per day or every hour.

## Take Action, Follow Up and Done

Of course, I have a system. Bare with me — it’s super easy.

Each read email can only be in one of these three states: Take Action, Follow Up and Done.

Take Action: there’s something for me to do.
Follow Up: it’s somebody else’s turn, but I want to make sure it’s getting done.
Done: Nothing to do for me. Enjoy your day.

Done

First, archive every email that doesn’t require any further action. For instance, I get a lot of automated emails from various systems. There’s obviously nothing to do for me here, so in most cases those go straight into my archive. Everything really that was just intenteted to inform me that is FYI I’m just CC’d on, depends on the sender if I read them at all, go straight into my archive that I labeled Done. 

Then go over each remaining email, top to bottom and if it’s something you can do in two minutes or less, do it right now. The idea is that as you’ve already started doing something — by reading and thinking about the email — it’s easier to just continue doing it rather to revisit that email later. This usually includes task like delegating larger tasks or quick responses to messages.

Now that those are out of the way, we should only have a few emails left in our inbox. These are the ones that either require more attention or hold a larger task you’re in charge of. I label those with Take Action. It’s a red label. The ball is in my corner. I usually have always one or two of those in my inbox. I work on them whenever I see fit.


There are five possible actions for each email: delete, delegate, respond, defer and do. First delete or archive as many new messages as possible. Then forward what can be best answered by someone else. Immediately respond to any new messages that can be answered in two minutes or less. Move new messages that require more than two minutes to answer -- and messages that can be answered later -- to a separate "requires response" folder. Set aside time each day to respond to email in the "requires response" folder or chip away at mail in this folder throughout the day.

## Don’t use email (for that)

Email isn’t supposed to be answered immediately. 

 is [asynchronous communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_communication) and. If you have a “why-haven’t-you-answered-me-yet?!?” culture at your workplace, you’re doing it wrong.

## Emails create more emails

One night I had a significantly delayed red-eye flight from New York to Munich. I thought, why not making the best out of it and work off all my emails? A few hours later, I was boarding the plane with an empty inbox, feeling totally awesome and accomplished. You can probably guess what happened when I turned on my laptop in Munich the next day - I had even more emails in my inbox than I had before. I felt devastated.

## Declare bankruptcy

A few of you might have followed that downward-spiral of mismanaged email for far too long and are now in a huge mess: thousand of unread emails clutter your inbox. Every time you dare opening your inbox you feel overwhelmed, break out in panic sweat and know — deep down — there’s no way you’ll ever manage to keep up. If that sounds all too familiar it’s time to declare email bankruptcy. Mark all your emails as read and archive them, or just delete them altogether. Yes, I’m serious: delete all your emails. It’s scary but important stuff will bubble up again. Trust me, it will free you.
