This is my Manager README, a user guide for me that helps introduce you to my management style, philosophy, expectations, and some of my, um, nuances. My intent with this document is to hopefully accelerate building our working relationship and is by no means meant as a replacement for actually getting to know each other.

If you have any feedback for me, please give it. It could be something you liked and would like to see more of, something you thought I could do better, something you thought I totally screwed up, or something that doesn't fit in any of these categories. Your feedback helps me to grow.

I prefer getting feedback in-person, but if it’s easier for you, feel free to kick off a discussion with an email or a message. If you're not comfortable giving me this feedback yourself, I'd love for you to give it to someone else so they can anonymously relay it to me and I can work on it.

You can expect clear and honest communication from me. I promise not to leave you guessing what I “really” think or expect you to read between the lines of what I’m saying. If it’s not clear, and you have a nagging feeling, please let me know so I can fix it! It’s not intentional.
