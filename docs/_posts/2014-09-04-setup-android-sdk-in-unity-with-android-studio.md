To build <a target="_blank" href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a> projects for Android the <a target="_blank" href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/">Android SDK</a> (Software Development Kit) needs to be installed. If you're using <a target="_blank" href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html">Android Studio</a> the SDK will be already part of that installation.

So far so good, but when Unity asks you to select the Android SDK root folder you'll have a problem because it is part of the Android Studio package and therefore isn't accessible to Unity.

To work around this let's create a symbolic link to the SDK's root folder in our **Applications** root. Open a Terminal window and execute the following command:

```
sudo ln -s /Applications/Android\ Studio.app/sdk /Applications/Android\ SDK
```

The command `ln` used with the option `-s` will create a symbolic link to the SDK location `/Applications/Android\ Studio.app/sdk` as `/Applications/Android\ SDK`.

Note that a backslash `\` before a space (e.g. `\ SDK`) is escaping that space to prevent it from being treated as a separator, hence part of that directory.

Voil√†. Now we can select the **Android SDK** root folder when Unity asks us:
