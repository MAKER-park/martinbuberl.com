# No Jerks

- teams that build high quality software can't have jerks on them
- jerks lower software quality because they hurt collaboration and collaboration is key for high quality software
- ‎there's no trade off - jerks always hurt
- ‎brilliant ideas aren't worth anything if they can't be vetted by rest of team (jerks rarely collaborate and rarely search for feedback)
- ‎jerks go rouge building "brilliant" things alone and have disproportional impact with lower quality code
- ‎how to rehab brilliant jerks
- ‎tell them: do you consider all the data? (emotional data, EQ)

- Technicall Strong Assholes (TSA)
  - 1.5x faster than other, maybe leading an important initiative
    - ... but make life hell for everbody else (1x -> .8x)

1 tsa x 1.5 strength + 9 engineers x .8 strength = 8.7 effort
0 tsa x 1.5 strength + 9 engineers x 1 strength = 9 effort
