A developer usually doesn't start working on a new task by simply hacking away code on their keyboard. This might come as a surprise if your opinion was mostly shaped by what you've seen on television.

She needs a phase to understand the task in front of her, assess all the variables and moving pieces, get concentrated and then finally when the mind is sharpened, she executes.

We refer to it as "being in the zone." This is where the magic happens. Think of it as a zen-like state of masterful execution understanding every nitty gritty detail of the problem.

Interrupting somebody who is “in the zone” hurts productivity.

That’s why most teams I know have some sort of rule in place

 or something similar, like a token displayed on top of their monitors.

By the way, if getting “into the zone” is too expensive - that might be a smell by itlself. It shouldn’t take days before somebody can start working, but it’s not immediately.




On my teams we enforce the [headphones rule] to make sure people in the zone or shifting gears are not interrupted:

- rulez
- ...

If you see those headphones rocking, don't come knocking.

Most teams


This is the most productive stage. Being in the zone is where the magic happens.

So we put up an effort


But that's not what I want to talk about. I'd like to talk about the transition of getting into the zone. It's what I call "shifting gears."

But getting there wasn't just a Selbstläufer

It's all about shifting gears and nothing should get into its way. Because that's were the magic happens.


Nothing is better suited to feel the pulse of a team than a good retrospective meeting.

They are incredibly important to reflect on what went well and what could be improved, help to discover individual or group pains, and assess the overall happiness of your team. Furthermore, a retrospectives gives you a great opportunity to address lessons learned or issues in a collaborative forum.

You probably know the

I usually start retrospectives with a random work unrelated activity to get everybody to loosen up and have a phase "to come down and shift gears" after work. These activities vary and usually take somewhere between 15 and 30 minutes.

You can think of them as little collaborative games or exercises, that are usually a lot of fun. You would be surprised how much grown ups love those little games - even if they sometimes don't want to admit it. It's a success every time.

Be interactive and include the room, post its, whiteboards, markers, LEGO and
A few of my favorites activities are:

- still post
- agree/disagree

You can make it a habit that every retrospective somebody else on the team is responsible to come up with an ice breaker activity.

It's not easy to find the sweet spot between
