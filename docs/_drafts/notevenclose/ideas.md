Hiring principles
- False positives are ok; false negatives are not

Hiring heuristics:

- Hire for trajectory vs experience
- Hire doers vs tellers
- Hire learners vs experts

- Always pass on ego

--- Small teams can do big things ---

Small teams can do big things
Small teams succeed if they keep it simple, reduce the amount of moving parts / complexity
That's how a small team can do big things like launching a rocket into space not being a government

--- Retros ---

Nothing is better suited to feel the pulse of a team than a good retrospective meeting.

They are incredibly important to reflect on what went well and what could be improved, help to discover individual or group pains, and assess the overall happiness of your team. Furthermore, a retrospectives gives you a great opportunity to address lessons learned or issues in a collaborative forum.

I usually start retrospectives with a random work unrelated activity to get everybody to loosen up and have a phase "to come down and shift gears" after work. These activities vary and usually take somewhere between 15 and 30 minutes.

You can think of them as little collaborative games or exercises, that are usually a lot of fun. You would be surprised how much grown ups love those little games - even if they sometimes don't want to admit it. It's a success every time.

Be interactive and include the room, post its, whiteboards, markers, LEGO and
A few of my favorites activities are:

- still post
- agree/disagree

You can make it a habit that every retrospective somebody else on the team is responsible to come up with an ice breaker activity.


--- Hackathons ---

Hackathon
Doing quarterly hackathons
Why are we doing it
Hackathons are strong with creativity, not so much for getting stuff out into production


Themed Hackathons / Hack Days: 1) Hack your own product 2) Have PO or PM pitch real world issues that you're trying to solve. That way they can take ownership after the hack day

Announce the theme one week before the Hackathon, so that people can start thinking about it.
