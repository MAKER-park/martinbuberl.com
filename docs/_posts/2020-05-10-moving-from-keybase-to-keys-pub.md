Because <a target="_blank" href="https://keybase.io/blog/keybase-joins-zoom">Zoom acquired Keybase</a> it was time for me to delete my account and look for alternatives. I genuinely liked Keybase and considered them being a <a target="_blank" href="https://martinbuberl.com/blog/the-culture-test-eight-steps-to-better-company-culture/#are-you-good">“good company”</a>. They were onto something, scratching an itch in the security space. While not perfect, they definitely did a lot right. It's a shame.

My personal reasons why I decided to not use Keybase anymore are:

- The lack of any “We're committed to keeping Keybase alive” statement.
- The vast majority of Zoom's software development team is based out of companies in China and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/24/uk-government-told-not-to-use-zoom-because-of-china-fears">this arrangement may make them responsive to pressure from Chinese authorities</a>.
- The popularity of Zoom technologies made it of high priority interest to multiple governments and a high priority target for signals intelligence gathering and targeted intrusion operations.
- The track record of Zoom to <a target="_blank" href="https://hn.algolia.com/?q=zoom">repeatedly prioritise ease-of-use over security and privacy</a>.

What's going to replace Keybase for me long-term is unclear, but right now the best alternative seems to be <a target="_blank" href="https://keys.pub/">keys.pub</a>. It's free and open-source software and despite its early stage it looks promising enough for me to give it a shot.

Are you planning to keep using Keybase? Found another alternative? Let me know!
